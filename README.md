### *Sovereign Intelligence. Absolute Equilibrium.*

**Materialize · Govern · Scale**

> An industrial-grade AI orchestration engine that builds, governs, and scales  
> sovereign digital verticals — from a single command to a production-ready ecosystem.

## 🧭 What is AIWF?

**New to AI tools?** Think of AIWF as a smart factory for software. You describe what you need to build — a fintech platform, a Red Sea tourism booking system, a medical records app — and AIWF generates the entire project structure, governance rules, compliance checks, content strategy, and deployment pipeline. Automatically. Under your control.

**For experienced engineers:** AIWF is a self-learning neural orchestration engine that implements Spec-Driven Development (SDD) with density-gated phases, C4 architecture diagrams, multi-CLI adapter routing (Claude/Gemini/Qwen/Kilo), sovereign Git ops, and a Law 151/2020 compliance layer — all wired into a single authoritative command tree.

### ✨ The Core Promise

```
One command → A fully spec'd, compliant, production-ready sovereign workspace

AIWF v20.2.0 extends the **Industrial OS Galaxy** (six OMEGA-certified workspace templates under **`factory/shards/`**) and a **manifest-driven design catalog** (provider `design.md` packs under `.ai/templates/design/` and `factory/library/design/`). **Spawn a new shard** from the repo root with:

`bash .ai/scripts/factory_materialize.sh` (or **`bash .ai/scripts/bin/materialize.sh`** — same file via convenience symlink)

Use the Cursor slash command **`/mat`** for the same instructions (run that script in a **terminal** — it prompts for template, layer, then slug). Alias: **`/factory materialize`**.

Generated audits and similar artifacts go under **`docs/reports/`** (not the repo root).

## 🔑 Key Features

| Feature | What It Means for You |
|---------|----------------------|
| 🏛️ **Sovereign Workspaces** | Every project is fully isolated, self-governing, and region-compliant — your data never leaves your jurisdiction without explicit approval |
| 🧠 **Neural Fabric Sync** | AI agents communicate and synchronize state across all your projects in real time |
| 🔒 **Law 151/2020 Built-In** | Egypt/MENA data residency enforcement is wired into the architecture — PII geofencing, anonymisation, and audit trails are automatic |
| 📐 **Spec Density Gate** | Every plan phase must have ≥12 spec files and mandatory C4 diagrams before it can proceed — no thin specs, ever |
| 🤖 **Multi-CLI Orchestration** | The same blueprint runs on Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Kilo, OpenCode — each adapter auto-assigned by task type |
| ⚡ **Tripartite Planning** | 8 plan types all sharing the same industrial-grade SDD structure — from dev sprints to content campaigns |
| 🔗 **Reasoning Hash Traceability** | Every commit, spec, and mutation is signed with a deterministic `sha256` hash — full audit trail from idea to deploy |
| 🛡️ **Self-Healing Architecture** | Healing Bot v2 detects structural drift and auto-remediates within 100ms |
| 🚀 **12-Point OMEGA Release Gate** | No version ships without passing mirror drift, path integrity, residency, traceability, and 8 other certification checks |
| 🌐 **P2P Node Engine** | Factory-internal peer discovery and secure component exchange across nodes |
| 🎨 **Design Catalog & External Sync** | Provider-level `design.md` packs, `catalog.json`, and `external_library_sync.py` merge reports under `factory/library/reports/` — keeps UI guidance library-current |

/guide plan development                 # See the development SDD lifecycle
/plan blueprint --from 00-foundation    # Start a new development blueprint
/audit health                           # Check ecosystem health score
/guide brainstorm about [your idea]     # 3-direction creative exploration
```

## 🛡️ Compliance & Sovereignty

### Law 151/2020 — Egypt Data Protection

AIWF is built around Egyptian Law 151/2020 (the Personal Data Protection Law). This isn't an add-on — it's wired into the architecture at every layer:

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Data Residency** | All MENA data stays on `MENA-SOIL-EGY-01` (aws:me-central-1) |
| **PII Geofencing** | `regional_controller_bridge` agent enforces geospatial locks on every mutation |
| **Arabic Content** | Arabic tasks route to Qwen + mandatory Law 151 anonymisation checklist |
| **Audit Trail** | Every mutation: ISO-8601 timestamp + `sha256` reasoning hash |
| **Pre-push Gate** | `push_gate.py` validates residency before every `git push` |
| **Phase Compliance** | Every SDD phase contains `regional_compliance.md` |

### The Reasoning Hash

Every commit and spec output carries a deterministic traceability signature:

```
feat(content): add phase-03 detailed design
[Reasoning: sha256:591f4801ce2127b9] [Law151: certified]
```

### The 12-Point OMEGA Audit

| # | Gate | Threshold |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Mirror Drift | 0.00% |
| 2 | Path Integrity | No root pollution |
| 3 | Data Residency | Law 151 geofencing active |
| 4 | Reasoning Hash Coverage | 100% of commits |
| 5 | Spec Density | ≥12 files per non-draft phase |
| 6 | C4 Diagrams | Context + Container present in every phase |
| 7 | Naming Convention | 100% `snake_case` |
| 8 | Agent Registry | No ID collisions |
| 9 | Pre-commit Hook | Installed and active |
| 10 | Planning Mirror | Sync manifest current |
| 11 | Swarm Locks | No stale mutex files |
| 12 | Industrial Health | Score ≥ 95/100 |

## 🤝 Contributing & Governance

AIWF operates under a **Sovereign Commit Protocol**. All contributions must:

1. Pass the pre-commit gate (`snake_case` on first-party paths; documented **skip prefixes** for vendored trees such as `factory/library/skills/github_imports/` and `factory/library/skills/nexu_open_design/`; no `TODO_P_L_A_C_E_H_O_L_D_E_R`; mirror drift < threshold)
2. Carry a reasoning hash in the commit message
3. Include a Law 151/2020 certification flag for MENA-touching changes
4. Pass spec density gate on all modified plan phases (exit code 0)

```bash
# Correct sovereign commit format:
feat(content): add phase-04 tasks and contracts [Reasoning: sha256:abc123] [Law151: certified]
```

Workspace-to-library promotions require 3-agent consensus + governor approval via `/library promote`.
